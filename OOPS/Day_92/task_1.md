### ðŸš• JavaScript-Based Cab Service â€“ Problem Statement

A private Cab service company provides services within the city at the following rates:

| Type           | Upto 5 KM | Beyond 5 KM |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| **AC Car**     | â‚¹150      | â‚¹10 per KM  |
| **Non-AC Car** | â‚¹120      | â‚¹8 per KM   |

---

### ðŸ“Œ Design a JavaScript class named `CabService` with the following:

#### ðŸ”¸ **Properties (Data Members):**

* `car_type` â†’ A string to store type of car ("AC" or "NON AC")
* `km` â†’ A number to store kilometers travelled
* `bill` â†’ A number to calculate and store the total bill

#### ðŸ”§ **Methods:**

1. **Constructor `constructor()`**
   Initialize:

   * `car_type` to an empty string (`""`)
   * `km` and `bill` to `0.0`

2. **`accept(carType, km)`**
   Accepts user input for car type and kilometers travelled

3. **`calculate()`**
   Calculates the total bill amount based on the car type and distance:

   * If car type is **AC**:

     * Up to 5 KM: â‚¹150
     * Beyond 5 KM: â‚¹150 + â‚¹10 per extra KM
   * If car type is **NON AC**:

     * Up to 5 KM: â‚¹120
     * Beyond 5 KM: â‚¹120 + â‚¹8 per extra KM

4. **`display()`**
   Displays the bill in the following format:

   ```
   CAR TYPE: <car_type>
   KILOMETER TRAVELLED: <km>
   TOTAL BILL: â‚¹<bill>
   ```

---

### ðŸ§ª Task:

* Create an object of `CabService`
* Accept input using method `accept()`
* Call `calculate()` to compute bill
* Use `display()` to show output
